## PXB 2x | 6 Max | Better Loot | Fridays | Shared BPs
Project consisted of researching plugins written in C# and properly configuring them in their corresponding JSON Config. The purpose was to allow people to play on a server free from payment and enjoyable to everyone.

Unfortunately I began to work on other projects and had hopes that it would be self-sufficient without much need for advertisements or further expenses I found unnecessary. My focus went away from the server to develop other projects.
